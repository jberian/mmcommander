MMSimulator
===========

    MMsimulator for MMCommander. 
    Sniffer and Pump-glucometer-enlite sensor simulator.

    This is a small simulator / sniffer to be used with MMCommander in Linux.
    Can be run without specifing pump, glucometer or sensor IDs and will
    work in sniffer mode.

    Be careful when using real IDs. You could affect to your pump
    or Medtronic system. This tool was created to develop the uploader
    without using a real system, that's why the simulator does not
    respond to all commands.
